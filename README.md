# The-FPGA-based-Image-Filtering-Accelerator-for-Edge-Detection-FIFA-ED-
The project uses xilinx vivado for deployment and commissioning on FPGA and OpenCV python as a Goldern standard. It builds on sobel edge algorithm, and  advances to Canny algorithm for its Gaussian Filter of a 5x5 kernel for smoother and more accurate edge detections.
